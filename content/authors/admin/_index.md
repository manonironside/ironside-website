Manon Ironside is a PhD candidate in clinical science at the University of California Berkeley. She will be completing her final year in the PhD between 2022-23 as a predoctoral clinical intern at the University of California San Francisco in the Child and Adolescent Services Multicultural Clinical Training Program.

Manon's research interests include selection processes during goal-directed decision making (e.g. the explore-exploit dilemma) in the context of mood disorders, and reinforcement learning across mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders.
